# Tableau Sales Comparison Dashboard

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to assist an organization in comparing sales performance across two regions using a visual dashboard. The organization's director requested that sales data be compared across regions in order to better understand their performance. This dashboard will allow upper management to evaluate the performance of the regions and recommend improvements.

The Sample Superstore dataset is used for creating a dashboard that compares sales in the primary and secondary regions. Key metrics such as total sales, average sales per order, the number of customers, number of orders, and the number of products in sale are displayed.

## Objective
Create an interactive Tableau dashboard that visualizes the sales comparison between two selected regions based on the Sample Superstore dataset. The dashboard will include the following metrics for both regions:

 --> First Order Date
 
 --> Total Sales
 
 --> Average Sales per Order
 
 --> Number of Customers
 
 --> Number of Orders
 
 --> Number of Products in Sale
 
## Datasets Used
Sample Superstore Dataset


## How to Run
  --> Download the Sample Superstore dataset if not already available.
  
  --> Open the Tableau workbook (.twb or .twbx) file.
  
  --> Connect the dataset to Tableau.
  
  --> Use the filters to select the Primary and Secondary regions and interact with the dashboard to compare sales performance.
  
## Conclusion
This project provides an intuitive, interactive visualization that helps management understand the sales performance of different regions. It allows for easy identification of trends and opportunities for improvement.

## Notes:
Replace Dashboard.twbx with the actual file name if necessary.
